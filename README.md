# One-Shot Handwritten Character Classifier with BPL

A Python implementation of a one-shot handwritten character classifier using **Bayesian Program Learning (BPL)** and **modified Hausdorff distance** as a similarity metric. This script evaluates the ability to classify new characters based on only one example, simulating a "one-shot" learning scenario.

Inspired by the original research work from [Brenden Lake's GitHub repository](https://github.com/brendenlake/BPL).

## 📌 Overview

This project implements a one-shot handwritten character classification system, drawing inspiration from the **Bayesian Program Learning (BPL)** framework. The classifier leverages pixel coordinates and modified Hausdorff distance to compare shapes and determine similarity between characters.

The implementation is based on an open-source MATLAB version by [Brenden Lake](https://github.com/brendenlake/BPL), which has been translated into Python for easier use and integration with modern data science workflows.

---

## 📌 Features

- **One-shot learning**: Classify new characters using only a single example.
- **Modified Hausdorff distance**: A robust measure of shape similarity between two sets of coordinates.
- **Multiple runs**: Average error rate is computed across multiple independent classification experiments.
- **Modular and extensible design** for easy customization.

---

## 📌 Approach & Methodology

The classifier follows the principles of **Bayesian Program Learning (BPL)** as described in [Lake et al. (2015)](#citation), where characters are represented by their pixel coordinates, and classification is performed through similarity comparisons using a cost function.

### Key Steps:
1. Load image pixel coordinates.
2. Compute modified Hausdorff distance between test and training samples.
3. Select the most similar training example as the predicted class.
4. Evaluate performance using percentage error rate across multiple runs.

## 📦 Requirements

Make sure to install the following dependencies:

```bash
pip install numpy scipy imageio
```

## 📁 Directory Structure

The project expects a specific directory structure for input data:

```
one-shot-classifier/
│
├── all_runs/               # Contains training and test data
│   ├── run01/
│   ├── run02/
│   └── ...                 # Each run has its own label file (`class_labels.txt`)
│
├── README.md               # This file
└── one_shot_classifier.py  # Main implementation script
```

> ⚠️ **Note:** All image files and label files should be placed in the `all_runs/` directory.

---

## 🚀 How to Use

### Step-by-step Instructions:

1. **Prepare your data**:
   - Store images in the `all_runs/` directory with corresponding subfolders.
   - Ensure each folder has a file named `class_labels.txt`, containing pairs of test and training image paths, separated by spaces.

2. **Run the classifier**:

```bash
python one_shot_classifier.py
```

3. **Output**:
   - The script will run multiple classification tests (default: 20 runs), displaying error rates for each.
   - It concludes with an average error rate across all runs.

---

## 📊 Example Output

Here’s what you might see after running the classifier:

```
Running one-shot handwritten character classifier
Run 01: Error rate 4.5%
Run 02: Error rate 3.8%
...
Average error rate across 20 runs: 4.2%
```
